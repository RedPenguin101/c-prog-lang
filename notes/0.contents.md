4. functions and program structure
5. pointers and arrays

7. IO
8. UNIX


# preface
1. the ANSI standard for c: from 1983. formalises constructions, included in this book.
2. stuff about standard library
3. tried to retain the brevity.
4. not very high level language, not a big one
5. essentially all UNIX is written in C
6. this isn't an intro to programming, assumes familiarity with concepts.

# intro
1. 'system programming language' - though general purpose and flexible
2. C is not a 'typeless' language like it's parent 'BCPL'
3. fundemental types: 'characters, integers, floats.
4. derived types hierarchy
5. expressions formed by operators and operands. any expression can be a statement.
6. control flow constructions: `if-else`, `switch`, `while`, `for`, `do`, `break`

## low level language
1. no operations to deal with composite objects', manipulate entire arrat at once.
2. no defined storage allocation, no heap, garbage collections.
3. No IO, read/writes. 
4. single thread, no parallel operations.
5. this is a feature.

## ANSI
1. major contribution: the standard library
2. not initially strong typed, but type checking has evolved.
